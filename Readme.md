# JDBC HW 

## Follow these steps:

* Create a program that can be used by a bookstore clerk. The program should allow the clerk to:

    * enter new books into the database

    * update book information
    
    * delete books from the database

    * search the database to find a specific book.

* Create a database called ebookstore and a table called books. The table should have the following structure:

<img src="table-struc.png" width="80%"/>

* Populate the table with the above values. You can also add your own values if you wish.

* The program should present the user with the following menu:

    <br>
                1. Enter book <br />
                2. Update book <br />
                3. Delete book <br />
                4. Search books <br />
                0. Exit 

    <br>

* The program should perform the function that the user selects. The implementation of these functions is left up to you.

* Feel free to add more functionality and complexity to the program. This is your chance to show off all the programming concepts you have learnt so far!
